# About OPEN MINDS tech stack
Our team is not large enough to discern between front-end, backend, and devops. As such, engineers are expected to handle a variety of full-stack responsibilites. This can include creating/managing WordPress plugins, styling WordPress themes, debugging production code, hosting & 3rd party configuration.. you name it, when it comes to anything web, the buck stops here. It's a great gig for anyone who seeks variety.

While we understand that everyone has their own preferred way of doing things, we do strive to standardize our development processes and tools. Doing so allows our engineers to be flexible and easily coloborate with other engineers. We believe this is critical for a small team in a fast-paced environment where priorities can quickly shift.

## Content Management
  * WordPress - OPEN MINDS is a content publisher We also help our clients publish content. Given that, most of our work is with content style websites, for which we use WordPress. 

## Laravel
  * We have a few custom tools we use internally that are built using Laravel.

## CSS Frameworks
  * Tailwind CSS - As it stands now, all of our engineers are primarily backend, so treating css from a utility approach is preferred.
  * Bootstrap & Foundation - Mostly legacy.

## Databases
  * MySQL
  * Elasticsearch

## Version Control & Deployment
  * GitLab - Preferred. We utilize the CI tools for deployment.
  * Github + Deploybot. We are currently phasing out. All new projects should be set up on GitLab.

## Communication
  * Slack, GroupWise (email)

## Project Management
  * Microsoft Project, Sharepoint

## Local Development Server
  * This is up to the engineer, but we highly recomend and support [10updocker](https://10up.github.io/wp-local-docker-docs/). However, feel free to use any environment as long as you can utilize tools such as or similar to WP-CLI, MailCatcher, phpMyAdmin
